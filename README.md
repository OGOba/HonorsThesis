# HonorsThesis
This is my underg graduate Honors Thesis
The population listed is students who matriculated at GSU at the Bachelors level between Fall 2010 and Fall 2020 at a full-time status.  For Bachelors students, that is taking 12 or more hours in that initial term.  Students who died while attending GSU have been excluded.
There are multiple files in this data collection.
1.	GSU Data Cohorts 2010-2020 - This is the main dataset of the student population.  Each student has one record.  The dataset contains the variables listed in the table below.
2.	Term Validation Table – This table lists the term code value, the longer name, the start and end date of that term, and the census date.  The census date is when the official enrollment snapshot for that term is taken.
3.	Clearinghouse CNTLRPT – This is the Control Report returned from the Clearinghouse for the query.  It will show statistics around the number of records for which matches were found and other notes about the query results.
4.	Clearinghouse DETLRPT – This is the Detail Report returned from the Clearinghouse.  There is a record for each student enrolled for a term at each university.  For example, if a student enrolled for eight semesters at GSU, there will be eight records for that student at GSU.  If that same student enrolled at Kennesaw State University for a summer term, then there will be a additional single record for that term at Kennesaw.  
a.	The ID numbers should match the ID numbers in the GSU Data Cohorts dataset.  They should connect to each other.
